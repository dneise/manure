# manure
Very lightweight, helps "production" as typically done in FACT. Be it analysis or simulation

### why the name?

I wanted to call it manufacture, but I don't like always adding the "fact" to all [fact related](https://github.com/fact-project/) software I write. So I took the fact out of manu-fact-ure, hence "manure". I hope it helps you growing your analysis results as much as it helped me.
